# Theorem Prover Shootout

A theorem prover shootout, in the spirit of [The Great Computer Language Shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Language_Benchmarks_Game),
for challenging verification problems that occur in practice.

The current focus is on real-world (*not* synthetic) mixed bitvector and arithmetic problems.
We **welcome pull requests** of new problems, and solutions to existing problems in different solvers.


#### Directory Structure

- Each problem is a toplevel directory, such as `P1/`.
- Each solution for a given theorem prover is a subfolder, such as `P1/lean`.
