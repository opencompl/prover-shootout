# Theorem Prover Shootout

A theorem prover shootout, in the spirit of [The Great Computer Language Shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Language_Benchmarks_Game),
for challenging verification problems that occur in practice.

The current focus is on real-world (*not* synthetic) mixed bitvector and arithmetic problems.
